Starboy
Chapter 1: Born of the Comet

The rain lashed through the forest at midnight, blurring the edges of acacia and baobab under a storm-heavy sky. Neo, fourteen and lean, ran on instinct through the thigh-high ferns, branches slashing at his face and arms. The earth underfoot was slick mud, each step threatening to slide him into a tangle of roots. Lightning split the sky overhead, turning the forest momentarily into a jagged silhouette of gray and black. Thunder boomed behind him, rattling the bones in his chest. Neo didn’t notice. He was focused on the pounding of his own heart.

Behind him, shapes crept in the darkness: Shadow Children, unnatural ghosts born of the Dark Circle. Pale-flickering figures floated between the tree trunks, their glowing eyes burning through the black. A chorus of whispered voices wound around Neo’s mind: “No one hears you…” “Trapped forever…” Another cried with a child’s giggle that twisted into a hyena’s bark. A cold dread slithered down his spine. He could feel the shadows closing in, hungrily feeding on his fear.

Neo’s legs pumped faster. He risked a glance back: the wraithlike children flitted through the rain, stalking him. Slender limbs—colored a sickly grey—reached out, jagged fingers clawing at the air. One of them shrieked, a sound like tearing cloth, and Neo felt the air around him thicken. He knew their name for their power: Whispered Fear. The voices wormed under his skin, but he refused to slow. I didn’t survive this long to freeze now, Neo thought, pressing himself onward.

He was alone. Always alone, since the day they threw him from the village gates like garbage. Five long years in this storm-swamped wilderness, sleeping under twisted roots and foraging for baobab fruit, eating bugs to survive. Nights were cold and empty; all he had was the sky and its vastness to keep him company. When hunger clawed at him in the night, he remembered the naledi (star) that burned across the sky the night he was born. The priests had wrapped him in goatskin at the village altar under a blood-red comet. They called him Ngwana wa Naledi ya Phirima—Child of the Fire Star. He could almost hear his mother’s lullaby, softly sung in Setswana to the Badimo (ancestors) by firelight, until dawn took the song from her lips.

Neo’s throat tightened. His lungs burned with each ragged breath. The forest around him felt alive, watching. Every sharp crack of twig, every distant owl cry told him where the shadows lurked. He weaved between roots and fallen logs by memory, each turn calculated. He remembered his old hiding places, blood pounding in his ears. Water pounded in his boots as he rounded a bend—up ahead, he recognized it: the dry bed of a creek, stones polished by past floods. If he could stay in the water, the Shadow Children might lose his scent.

He veered to the left and splashed into the creek. Rainwater gushed around his ankles as he plunged into the shallow stream. Cold stabbed through his soaked skin, but it was a welcome jolt. The water muffled the rustling of leaves, drowning out whispers of doubt. Neo ran on, the current churning around his calves, lightning briefly illuminating the riverbed with each flash.

He dared a quick glance back. One of the Shadow Children lunged to catch up. Its eyes glowed like ember coals, and it slipped on a mossy rock with a wet squish. Neo seized the chance. He grabbed a fist-sized rock from the forest floor and hurled it backward with all his might.

The rock hurtled through the air and struck the creature’s ghostly arm with a crack like thunder. The creature shrieked—an angry, piercing shriek—and stumbled back. Neo followed up; with a swift kick, he sent the wraith tumbling into the shallow water. It gave one final gurgling wail and dissolved into ragged clouds of black mist.

A triumphant grin crossed Neo’s face. “Outsmarted you,” he whispered over the thunder. He scrambled over a fallen termite log that bridged the creek, hands steadying him on the wet, grainy wood. Branches snapped underfoot as he sprinted. Behind him, the Shadow Children hissed and flitted like angry moths around the bright trace of his passing. They were relentless; but he was no easy prey.

The forest suddenly opened into the mouth of a narrow ravine. It gaped ahead of him like the throat of some giant, one side a sheer wall of limestone, the other jagged with fallen stones and vines. The ravine was black and endless. Neo’s chest heaved. There was nowhere left to run. The trees overhead wove into a dense roof of thorns, blocking even the starlight. He skidded to a stop at the ravine’s edge, mud flying around his wet boots, back pressed against the cold rock.

Every instinct screamed to fight. Neo gripped his spear tight. The rain hammered the stone around him. Silence pressed in; even the storm’s roar had dimmed under the stone canopy. “I didn’t survive this long to die here,” he told himself, though the words were lost to the thunder.

A soft, dissonant giggle filled the air—a child’s taunt in the cramped, dark space. Neo felt his heart skip a beat. His eyes darted upward. Lightning split the sky again, and in its brief flare he saw them: three Shadow Children perched on the ravine walls above, pale fingers probing the muddy water below, limbs thinner than birds’ yet holding them. Their eyes were wide and shining with hunger. The tallest shook its head and tilted it, and all three whispered in brittle chorus: “Always alone…”

Horror knotted in Neo’s gut. One of the creatures raised a bony hand and pointed at him. No escape… the whisper slithered in his mind, ice crawling over his blood. Neo snapped his teeth shut on the fear that threatened to choke him. He refused to give in.

A name shattered the chant—Ma… Neo’s thoughts were ripped back to a memory: a tiny boy in a grand hut, lullabies and smoke, his mother’s voice in the dark. He blinked and it was gone. He was in the ravine again, clutching his spear. His voice was swallowed by the storm.

Lightning flared across the sky. Neo’s eyes narrowed as something roared inside him: a spark of the old power in his blood. He had no time to think or hesitate. With a cry that tore from his chest, Neo screamed into the roaring storm.

A woman watched him from the edge of the forest.

The old Sangoma—her face lined like river bark, eyes deep and black as a midnight well—had followed the trace of a vision. She had seen him before the boat of clouds brought rain: a boy alone in a ravine with light in his chest. The vision had been split, like broken glass. She should have intervened earlier. In another life she could have brushed the Shadow Children aside as easily as swatting flies. But something in that vision had stopped her—an unfinished ending she could not ignore. She moved through the storm like a shadow of her own, following without revealing herself, curious and cautious. The spirits tugged at her sleeves as if saying, watch.

When the rock Neo threw cracked a phantom’s arm, she smiled—small and unstartled. The child can fight, she thought. But will he survive the ending the vision hides? The answer would tell her whether she had to break the old rules and step in.

Neo pressed himself into the deepest shadow of the ravine wall, his damp body against the cool limestone. The rain drummed above him, muffled by stone. Each breath he took was sharp and ragged. He could taste metal at the back of his throat. Fingers white-knuckled around the haft of his spear, he tried to steady himself. Across from him, the jagged wall climbed out of sight, draped with moss and tangled vines. The place felt empty and ancient, like a stone tomb.

Above him, on narrow rocky ledges, the three Shadow Children regrouped. They peered down at him with glowing eyes and wide, hungry grins. Lightning flashed again. Neo saw their cruel faces—sunken cheeks and wicked smiles—and felt another stab of dread in his gut. One of them hissed a soundless laugh that echoed in the darkness, as cold and empty as the grave. Then, with fluid motion, one of the shadows dropped into the ravine, silent wings unfurling to catch its fall.

“Can I get a breath? These things are relentless and I’m getting tired of running,” Neo muttered under his breath in Setswana. He planted his bare feet in the mud and drew himself up to full height. He was surrounded. Each thump of water on stone was the heartbeat of the oncoming fight. His spear felt heavy and solid in his hands—a reminder that this was real, and that tonight he would make his stand.

The first Shadow Child leapt down into the muddy bank directly in front of him, claws outstretched. Neo reacted without thought. He braced with one foot and drove the tip of his spear forward as if spearing air—but in that instant, he drove it true. The shaft slid through the vaporous form with a chilling ting. The creature let out a sharp, keening shriek as if stabbed through flesh of glass. Neo felt nothing but cold air in his hands, but he followed through. With a grunt he kicked the phantom in the chest, sending it stumbling backward into the water. It slumped and with one final hiss of despair it erupted in a dark plume and vanished. The shriek faded into silence.

Two remained. One lunged at his side, talons slicing through the air, while the other crept up behind, nails clicking on stone. Neo twisted away from the first, but the second had him in its sight now. He spun in one fluid motion, facing the second attacker as he turned back to meet the other. The two shadows circled, waiting like jackals.

Images flickered in Neo’s head: a boy practicing with a sliver of wood tied with string, a makeshift sparring partner balanced on a termite mound. He felt the training in his bones—the way his wrist snapped, the arc of a strike learned from watching hunters. He feinted left and then right, swinging his spearhead upward like a battle hammer. It connected with a cracking swipe. The ghost thrashed, its mouth opening in a wordless scream as dark ichor spilled onto the ground beneath it. It slumped forward, and in a final gurgling breath it disappeared into ash and mist.

For a breathless moment, Neo stood alone among the shafts of rain and shattered leaves. Only the final Shadow Child remained. It skittered back along the ravine wall, and looked down at him, its face twisted in surprise and rage. Neo’s chest swelled as the last echoes of panic drained out of him, replaced by sharp focus. This ends now, he vowed.

Lightning split the sky one more time. In its brief flash, the last phantom reared back and darted toward a low outcropping above. It lashed out with brittle teeth, and Neo charged. He felt raw power surging through his veins. With a roar, he leapt forward, spear raised high. The tip jabbed toward nothingness—the Shadow Child was gone. In its place came only a shrill teeee! as its spirit dissolved in the storm’s fury, the echo swallowed by the rain.

Neo staggered back to his knees. The silence returned like a wave crashing to shore. He was alone; the Shadow Children were gone.

Only then did the adrenaline drain away. Neo’s chest heaved with exhaustion. He spat gritty blood into the mud. His vision swam with spots of gray. The deafening silence was broken only by the soft drip of his own blood into the puddle below.

He tried to stand and sagged. His arm throbbed where he must have been scratched—he tugged at his sleeve. A ribbon of crimson ran down his forearm from a deep gash. He pressed into it; the pain made him wince, but he breathed evenly. More marks showed themselves: shallow slashes across his calves, a long graze over his side, dark maroon against faded denim. He was bleeding, badly.

The rain pelted his wounds. Cold seeped into his muscles, beginning a slow ache. Muscles trembled from the fight and the fall. Neo pressed his palm to the wall to steady himself. He had won this battle... and yet exhaustion hung on him like a heavy cloak.

Lightning flashed. He blinked up at a shredded vine dangling above, the distant moon behind drifting clouds. One faint fear remained: he was utterly alone here, with no one to help, no place to go. He would have to walk out of the ravine on his own, wounded as he was. The thought would have broken a weaker boy. Neo growled to himself in stubborn defiance: “Ga ba tseye pelo, ga ke kitla ka bolawa fa.” (They won’t break my heart; I will not die here.)

He sank fully to the ground, drawn down by pain. The spear slipped from his numb fingers and clattered on the stones. He wrapped both arms around his knees, trying to still the trembling. He matched his heartbeat to the rhythm of the dripping rain, fighting to steady his nerves.

The Sangoma watched. The vision had wavered and then returned—stronger now. The boy beneath the storm was not simply surviving; something answered him. Badimo, she breathed. Ancestors stirred when called. That was the heartbeat she recognized. The air itself changed, a low hum that threaded through the vines and stung her skin. She realized, with the old drum-beat certainty of her kind, that this was the moment the vision hid: a child who could call the dead. A gift. Or a weapon.

She kept her face quiet. The spirits that braided her hair called to her like kin. She could step down into the ravine and lay both hands on the boy and the spirits would obey. But there was a thread of something else in the current—a foul stitch sewn into the village’s dreams that named itself tokoloshe (a malicious spirit). If the village knew a child could wake such power, they would either worship him or burn him. That was not for her to decide. She would watch. When the ending demanded interference, she would answer.

Then the voice came—soft and ancient—in the thunder’s hollow. “Ngwana wa naledi,” a voice as close as his own breath said, repeating the name that had been folded into his life like a secret. The ravine hummed. The air warmed. Neo’s wounds prickled as if kissed by embers.

Power, old as bones and hot as a spearhead, rose inside him.

His breath shuddered into a cry that tore the sky. The rain stilled in a ring around him, and lightning hung like a photograph. Time narrowed to a pinhole. Neo felt every scar in his flesh flare like brand marks. A warmth climbed his spine and settled behind his eyes: starlight mixed with blood. He felt hands not his hands—callused palms and warrior fingers—press into the hollow of his chest.

A shape flared beside him, not fully formed but as real as a dream. It stood taller than any man, cloaked in a darkness that swallowed light and spit out sparks. A spear of living fire appeared in that hand, its flame cold and bright as the comet that had watched his birth. The specter moved with the slow, sure carriage of those who had fought and returned to tell of it. Old songs rose in Neo’s head, nameless verses and the terrible weight of memory.

The ancestral spirit—Badimo—had answered.

It struck like a comet.

A spear of light arced from the ancestor’s hand and lanced the ravine. The ground trembled. Vines snapped, rain exploded outward. Shadow Children screamed, a chorus of thin, shrieking notes. The light sheared through the dark like a king’s blade. Where the spear touched, the night spat ash; the phantoms dissolved, fibers of their bodies floating away like burnt paper.

Neo felt the cost as a flame. Power always took a toll. Blood swam in his vision and his knees went soft. He had opened that doorway without a map. The spectral warrior—his father’s face painted in star-silver—moved with a terrible grace and struck. A shadow child lunged with jagged teeth; the spear of the Badimo spun, and the creature was no more than a gasp and a rotten scent of smoke as it collapsed into the mud.

The ravine shook. Rocks split. The ancestor’s aura burned the leaves into curling silver. Neo felt his own lungs try to empty themselves of life and fill with light. Pain and ecstasy braided in his chest. When the last shadow stuttered and collapsed, the world let out a single, low groan, and the rain resumed as though nothing had happened.

Neo dropped to his knees. Exhaustion crashed into him like surf. His bones felt hollowed but thrumming with electricity. The spirit’s presence thinned, then folded back into the black of the night as if it had never been more than an echo. Neo’s hands trembled against the dirt. He tasted copper and ash on his tongue.

When he opened his eyes, the Sangoma was at the edge of the ravine, cloak clinging to her shoulders, breaths shallow. Her hands flexed as if she had walked in spirits. Her eyes glittered with something like fear and—unexpectedly—respect. The village would feel the echo. The world would tilt.

Neo tried to stand and his legs buckled. He thought for a second he would gag on a thin laugh, the kind that comes after waking from a bad dream and realizing you survived. Instead he coughed, and gritty mud came up in his mouth. The spear lay near him, wet and dull, and a smear of black dust clung to his palms—the remnants of the phantoms.

How many times will I have to do this? he thought, a childish ferocity burning beneath the fatigue. How many times will the Badimo have to drag me from the throat of the dark?

He thought of the village gates that had closed on him. He thought of the faces that had turned away. He thought of a mother’s hand smoothing his hair, then of ivory teeth flashing in the dark. Rage flared and went cold.

Footsteps thudded above the ravine. The wood of the village ladders creaked as men moved toward the source of light and storm. Torches bobbed. Voices rose—sharp, thick with alarm. The Sangoma turned and slipped back from the ravine like a shadow being swallowed. Her eyes found Neo’s, and for a moment the future passed between them like a folded coin. She mouthed one word and then bent away: “Tsela.” (Go.)

Neo pushed himself forward. He should have run. He should have vanished into the long grasses like he always did. But the village was where the story had started. The pain singing through his muscles said he would not run far. He stumbled toward the path that led back to the compound, toward the lights and smoke and the brittle safety of home—such as it had ever been.

He did not collapse a second time. He barely felt the village’s dust as his shoes struck packed earth. The compound gates were already awake; watchers perched on the palisade like crows. Torches painted faces with orange. The chief’s clan banners snapped in the wind—flames carved into cloth that seemed to suck up the rain.

They saw the glow first: a streak of unnatural light still hovering like a bruise above the ravine. The villagers pointed and whispered. Mothers clutched children; dogs howled. Someone began to chant—old warding words meant to keep demons at bay. Neo staggered through the crowd. People parted around him, eyes wide with a mixture of fear and hunger—fear because of what he might bring, hunger because spectacle fed the village like bread.

The Kgosi’s (chief’s) guards found him slumped at the edge of the square. One boy—Banele, the Kgosi’s son, all lean angles and angry eyes—stared at him like a judge. He had not forgotten Neo, and Neo felt the memory like salt in a wound: the last time their gazes had met, Banele had been a boy who held a warm milk bowl and had spat at him.

“You,” Banele spat when he had the chance. “They said—” He faltered, the words missing their cruelty for the shock of seeing him alive. A rumor that the chief had fed Neo to lions clung in the air like a cloud of flies. Rumors like that died hard, but no one had expected to find the child returned at all.

An elder Sangoma—different from the watcher in the trees—stepped forward. She smelled of herbs and old firelight. She had seen the aftermath before: the scorch of spirit and the blue residue of ancestral power. Her fingers trembled as she reached for Neo’s arm and found him warm and bleeding and somehow whole.

“Badimo,” she whispered. The word rolled like drum-thunder through the circle. Faces leaned closer, hungry for meaning. Some spoke the old curse like a prayer against an illness: tokoloshe, tokoloshe. Fear chewed the crowd.

Banele’s mouth twisted. He wanted to take a spear and drive it through the boy’s heart for the rumor that had stuck like a brand. But the elders muttered and argued in hushed tones, and the Kgosi himself—the chief—sat up on his elevated platform, pipe in hand, eyes the embers of a fire that refused to die.

He watched Neo the way a man watches a blade—wary, calculating. The echo of the comet night lay on his face: guilt and dread. People said the comet was a sign, they said it burned an omen into the sky; they said the chief had made difficult choices when the Badimo’s name fluttered in the winds. They had cast out a baby that had been born beneath the comet’s tail—and since then, nightmares had come in cycles: sudden sickness, flocks dying in the night, children waking from sleep shrieking about teeth in the dark. The village had made a bitter bargain. Now that bargain hummed in Neo’s blood.

The Sangoma noticed the chief’s hands clenched on his pipe. His knuckles were white. He had told himself a thousand times that the burning star meant necessary sacrifice. But his eyes—those smoked, tired eyes—betrayed his sleep-haunted conscience. Tonight, a beacon had flared where he had thrown a life away.

Neo was lowered onto a woven mat and carried into a hut smelling of herbs and smoke, a place where the elder Sangoma set him down and examined the wounds with steady hands. She spoke softly at first, naming herbs and binding cloth, spitting words that were half prayer, half medicine.

“The Badimo answered,” she murmured. “A Child of the Comet, returned.”

Neo’s voice came out as a dry whisper. “They followed me.” He tasted ash still in his mouth. “They tried to take me.”

The Sangoma—older, practiced—looked at him with an unreadable expression. “They do not take what the Badimo have set their mark on,” she said simply. But then she added, softer, “And nor do they forget.”

Outside, the village murmured like bees in a hive. The Kgosi rose and pointed toward the rafters. A messenger. Voices rose and sank. Someone said, “The Dark Circle moves.” Someone else said, “It is only a child.”

At dawn, Neo stepped out of the hut into a village that stared like a living thing. The compound’s banners hung heavy with rain. Smoke from ritual fires twisted toward the sky. Each hut looked like a small world, and each one had a story of pain or triumph stitched into thatch and clay. Neo felt exposed. The amulet—his small carved wooden eye, the only thing from the night of his birth—was warm beneath his shirt. The Sangoma who had watched in the trees had disappeared into the crowd like she had never been. But she had left the scent of smoke on his sleeve and a certainty in him that he was not entirely alone.

Men clustered near the dais where the Kgosi sat, wrapped in a dark cloak. Banele hovered like a specter, jaw tight. The Kgosi’s eyes scanned Neo as if weighing the boy’s life against a ledger of politics and prophecy. Finally, his voice rose: slow, authoritative, like a bell in a fog.

“Child of the Comet,” he said. The name rolled across the assembly and settled like ash. “You have returned.”

People breathed as if they were relieved. Some breathed out fear. The Kgosi’s voice held a promise and a threat. The word badimo moved around like an idol; it was precious enough to be worshiped and dangerous enough to be burned.

Neo pulled up his sleeve so the elder Sangoma could see the marks on his arms, the proof of battle. The woman’s fingers brushed his skin like a blessing and a caution. She said nothing of revenge or of crowns. She said only, “You must learn to guard the door you opened.”

Neo’s jaw set. Heat burned behind his ribs. I will find why they died. I will make it right, he vowed in the private language of his chest. The promise felt heavy and holy. He thought of his mother—her hands in the dough, her laugh like a broken bell—and then of the names he had never known: cousins, uncles, a clan burned like dry grass. He had been told they were traitors, or ghosts, or victims of a foolish king. He did not know which was truer, but he wanted to know.

At dusk the Sangoma from the ravine came to him. Her hands smelled of rain and crushed leaves. She sat across from him, silent for a while, the firelight making shallow maps on her face.

“You should not call them by name in open air,” she said finally. Her voice was low, almost velvet. “The Tokoloshe hears. The Dark Circle listens to the bone-wind. They will send spies.” She looked toward the grasses beyond the palisade. “Not all of them are foolish enough to show themselves.”

Neo tightened his grip on the carved amulet under his shirt. “What is the Tokoloshe?” he asked, because the question had been a shadow in the village for as long as he could remember. What is the thing the chief blamed for everything?

She regarded him for a long moment. “A trick that wears a smile,” she said. “Small as a rat, clever as a snake. It crawls into a man’s sleep and coils around his reason. The Dark Circle dresses its monsters in the shape of children because men will not see monsters in a child’s face. They will lower their guard.”

Neo’s shoulder twitched. He felt the weight of their words like a hand on his neck. He had tasted the Dark Circle and lived. He had burned them away with the flames of an ancestor’s spear, and for that the village would likely mark him as both curse and blessing.

He walked outside into a sky freckled with stars. The comet had faded to a pale smear but still glowed like a memory. Neo stood beneath it and felt very small and very large at the same time. All his life had been swept into this: a boy on the edge of a village, a name stitched into the heavens, and a power that tasted like metal.

He thought of the faces that had turned from him the day they threw him out: men who had not understood fear and had chosen certainty over mercy. He thought of the elders who had whispered about omens and the tongues that had wagged rumors to warm winters.

He would find answers. He would pry at the rotten boards behind the chief’s palace and find the truth. He would trace the Dark Circle to its nest. He would not be a child that stared up and wished. He would be the hand that pulled the truth into the light and held it for all to see.

“I will find out why they died,” he said aloud to the silent stars. His breath drew smoke in the cold. “And make it right.”

The Sangoma’s hand found his shoulder, heavy and warm. She did not speak, but she did not need to. Her eyes were serious, and that seriousness was a benediction. Neo slid his hand under his shirt and touched the carved amulet—the little wooden eye his mother had pressed into his palm the night he was born. It thudded against his chest like a second heartbeat.

Beyond the ring of huts, where the grass met the dark line of the forest, something small and sly blinked and watched him. Two eyes like polished beads reflected the faint light of the star. The Tokoloshe—if it was what the Sangoma said—had been there when the Badimo answered. It had watched the power and it had smiled with a smile that had no teeth.

When Neo turned back toward the village, the comet’s tail had left a thin silver stitch across the sky. He tightened his grip on his spear and the amulet, and walked forward.

Night folded over the compound and the first chorus of drums began again, slow as a promise and not as comforting as it once had been. The village had a thousand tongues, and they would spin this night into rumor by morning. The chief would meet with elders. The Sangoma would choose her side or remain silent. Banele would sharpen his anger into a spear.

Neo did not know any of that yet. He only knew the ache in his muscles and the burning star in his blood. He only knew the vow in his chest and the small, patient threat behind the hut line: two pale eyes watching him like a creature that had patience for centuries.

The comet slid lower. The stars that had watched his exile became witnesses to his return.

He walked into the village that had once cast him away.

And from the dark beyond the palisade came a sound—a soft click, like a tongue pulled from the teeth. The Tokoloshe’s eyes blinked once, then twice, and in the thin hush of that breath Neo felt the future close like a fist.

He lifted his chin and kept walking.
