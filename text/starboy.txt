Chapter 1: Born of the Comet
The Chase Through the Storm
The rain lashed through the forest at midnight, blurring the edges of acacia and baobab under a storm-heavy sky. Neo, fourteen and lean, ran on instinct through the thigh-high ferns, branches slashing at his face and arms. The earth underfoot was slick mud, each step threatening to slide him into a tangle of roots. Lightning split the sky overhead, turning the forest momentarily into a jagged silhouette of gray and black. Thunder boomed behind him, rattling the bones in his chest. Neo didn’t notice. He was focused on the pounding of his own heart.

Behind him, shapes crept in the darkness: Shadow Children, unnatural ghosts born of the Dark Circle. Pale-flickering figures floated between the tree trunks, their glowing eyes burning through the black. A chorus of whispered voices wound around Neo’s mind: “No one hears you…” “Trapped forever…” Another cried with a child’s giggle that twisted into a hyena’s bark. A cold dread slithered down his spine. He could feel the shadows closing in, hungrily feeding on his fear.

Neo’s legs pumped faster. He risked a glance back: the wraithlike children flitted through the rain, stalking him. Slender limbs—colored a sickly grey—reached out, jagged fingers clawing at the air. One of them shrieked, a sound like tearing cloth, and Neo felt the air around him thicken. He knew their name for their power: Whispered Fear. The voices wormed under his skin, but he refused to slow. I didn’t survive this long to freeze now, Neo thought, pressing himself onward.

He was alone. Always alone, since the day they threw him from the village gates like garbage. Five long years in this storm-swamped wilderness, sleeping under twisted roots and foraging for baobab fruit, eating bugs to survive. Nights were cold and empty; all he had was the sky and its vastness to keep him company. When hunger clawed at him in the night, he remembered the naledi (star) that burned across the sky the night he was born. The priests had wrapped him in goat-skin at the village altar under a blood-red comet. They called him Ngwana wa Naledi ya Phirima—Child of the Fire Star. He could almost hear his mother’s lullaby, softly sung in Setswana to the Badimo (ancestors) by firelight, until dawn took the song from her lips.

Neo’s throat tightened. His lungs burned with each ragged breath. The forest around him felt alive, watching. Every sharp crack of twig, every distant owl cry told him where the shadows lurked. He weaved between roots and fallen logs by memory, each turn calculated. He remembered his old hiding places, blood pounding in his ears. Water pounded in his boots as he rounded a bend—up ahead, he recognized it: the dry bed of a creek, stones polished by past floods. If he could stay in the water, the Shadow Children might lose his scent.

He veered to the left and splashed into the creek. Rainwater gushed around his ankles as he plunged into the shallow stream. Cold stabbed through his soaked skin, but it was a welcome jolt. The water muffled the rustling of leaves, drowning out whispers of doubt. Neo ran on, the current churning around his calves, lightning briefly illuminating the riverbed with each flash.

He dared a quick glance back. One of the Shadow Children lunged to catch up. Its eyes glowed like ember coals, and it slipped on a mossy rock with a wet squish. Neo seized the chance. He grabbed a fist-sized rock from the forest floor and hurled it backward with all his might.

The rock hurtled through the air and struck the creature’s ghostly arm with a crack like thunder. The creature shrieked—an angry, piercing shriek—and stumbled back. Neo followed up; with a swift kick, he sent the wraith tumbling into the shallow water. It gave one final gurgling wail and dissolved into ragged clouds of black mist.

A triumphant grin crossed Neo’s face. “Outsmarted you,” he whispered over the thunder. He scrambled over a fallen termite log that bridged the creek, hands steadying him on the wet, grainy wood. Branches snapped underfoot as he sprinted. Behind him, the Shadow Children hissed and flitted like angry moths around the bright trace of his passing. They were relentless; but he was no easy prey.

He didn’t think of slowing. The forest suddenly opened into the mouth of a narrow ravine. It gaped ahead of him like the throat of some giant, one side a sheer wall of limestone, the other jagged with fallen stones and vines. The ravine was black and endless. Neo’s chest heaved. There was nowhere left to run. The trees overhead wove into a dense roof of thorns, blocking even the starlight. He skidded to a stop at the ravine’s edge, mud flying around his wet boots, back pressed against the cold rock.

Cornered in the Ravine
Every instinct screamed to fight. Neo gripped his spear tight. The rain hammered the stone around him. Silence pressed in; even the storm’s roar had dimmed under the stone canopy. “I didn’t survive this long to die here,” he told himself, though the words were lost to the thunder.

A soft, dissonant giggle filled the air—a child’s taunt in the cramped, dark space. Neo felt his heart skip a beat. His eyes darted upward. Lightning split the sky again, and in its brief flare he saw them: three Shadow Children perched on the ravine walls above, pale fingers probing the muddy water below, limbs thinner than birds’ yet holding them. Their eyes were wide and shining with hunger. The tallest shook its head and tilted it, and all three whispered in brittle chorus: “Always alone…”

Horror knotted in Neo’s gut. One of the creatures raised a bony hand and pointed at him. No escape… the whisper slithered in his mind, ice crawling over his blood. Neo snapped his teeth shut on the fear that threatened to choke him. He refused to give in.

“Ma…” A name shattered the chant. Neo’s mind was swept back to another time—a tiny boy in a grand hut, lullabies and smoke, his mother’s voice in the dark. He blinked and it was gone. He was in the ravine again, clutching his spear. His voice was gone, swallowed by the storm.

Lightning flared across the sky, a wall of white light in the darkness. Neo’s eyes narrowed as something roared inside him: a spark of the old power in his blood. He had no time to think or hesitate. With a cry that tore from his soul, Neo screamed into the roaring storm.

Then silence. Neo remained crouched, spear in hand, senses straining into the darkness.

The old Sangoma—her weathered face as still as a panther’s—appeared in the darkness of the tree watching silently. She was silent at first, waiting.

She came to help this little helpless boy she saw in her vision that she was in danger but the vision didn't give a clear ending she rushed to the spot she saw in her visions the reveen, but something is not right she feels she's been chasing the boy for the last 20 minutes, she could have easily taken care of these shadow children they were like a chore to her but she was curious about the ending of the vision so she kept a close follow behind him

She was surprised by how he bought one of these shadow children using the rock it wasn't enough but it's was effective to give him time to escape of course she took care of it when she got to pass it and now comes the interesting part of her vision

Neo pressed himself into the deepest shadow of the ravine wall, his damp body against the cool limestone. The rain drummed above him, but here the sound was muted by rock. Each breath he took was sharp and ragged. He could taste the metal of blood on his tongue. Fingers white-knuckled around the haft of his spear, he tried to steady himself. Across from him, the jagged wall climbed out of sight, draped with moss and tangled vines. The place felt empty and ancient, like a stone tomb.

Above him, on narrow rocky ledges, the three Shadow Children had regrouped. They peered down at him with glowing eyes and wide, hungry grins. Lightning flashed again. Neo saw their cruel faces—sunken cheeks and wicked smiles—and felt another stab of dread in his gut. One of them hissed a soundless laugh that echoed in the darkness, as cold and empty as the grave. Then, with fluid motion, one of the shadows dropped into the ravine with silent wings unfurling to catch its fall.

“Can I get a breath these things are relentless and I am getting tired from this running,” Neo muttered under his breath in Setswana. He planted his bare feet in the mud and drew himself up to full height. He was surrounded. Each thump of water on stone was the heartbeat of the oncoming fight. His spear felt heavy and solid in his hands—a reminder that this was real, and that tonight he would make his stand.

The first Shadow Child leapt down into the muddy bank directly in front of him, claws outstretched. Neo reacted without thought. He braced with one foot and drove the tip of his spear forward as if spearing air—but in that instant, he drove it true. The shaft slid through the vaporous form with a chilling ting. The creature let out a sharp, keening shriek as if stabbed through flesh of glass. Neo felt nothing but cold air in his hands, but he followed through. With a grunt he kicked the phantom in the chest, sending it stumbling backward into the water. It slumped and with one final hiss of despair it erupted in a dark plume and vanished. The shriek faded into silence.

Fury of the Ancestors
Two remained. One of them lunged at his side, talons slicing through the air, while the other crept up behind, nails clicking on stone. Neo twisted away from the first, but the second had him in its sight now. He spun in one fluid motion, facing the second attacker as he turned back to meet the other. The two shadows circled, waiting like jackals.

Neo’s memories sharpened for an instant: days of training with a sliver of wood in the wild, his instinct showing him how to hold a spear, how to strike a target. He snapped back to the present. He feinted left and then right, swinging his spearhead upward like a battle hammer. It connected with a cracking swipe. The ghost thrashed, its mouth opening in a wordless scream as dark ichor spilled onto the ground beneath it. It slumped forward, and in a final gurgling breath it disappeared into ash and mist.

For a breathless moment, Neo stood alone among the shafts of rain and shattered leaves. Only the final Shadow Child remained. It skittered back along the ravine wall, and looked down at him, its face twisted in surprise and rage. Neo’s chest swelled as the last echoes of panic drained out of him, replaced by sharp focus. This ends now, he vowed.

Lightning split the sky one more time. In its brief flash, the last phantom reared back and darted toward a low outcropping above. It lashed out with brittle teeth, and Neo charged. He felt raw power surging through his veins. With a roar, he leapt forward, spear raised high. The tip jabbed toward nothingness—the Shadow Child was gone. In its place came only a shrill teeee! as its spirit dissolved in the storm’s fury, the echo swallowed by the rain.

Neo staggered back to his knees. The silence returned like a wave crashing to shore. He was alone; the Shadow Children were gone.

Only then did the adrenaline drain away. Neo’s chest heaved with exhaustion. He spat gritty blood into the mud. His vision swam with spots of gray. As the spinning slowed, he realized the deafening silence was broken only by the soft drip of his own blood into the puddle below.

He tried to stand, and sagged. His arm throbbed where he must have been scratched—he tugged at the sleeve. A ribbon of crimson ran down his forearm from a deep gash. His fingers pressed into it; the pain made him wince, but he breathed evenly. He looked down and saw more: a series of slash marks across his calf, dark maroon against faded denim. Each wound sent electricity thundering through him. He was bleeding, badly.

The rain pelted his wounds. The cold seeped into his bones, starting a slow ache. Muscles trembled from the fight and the fall. Neo pressed his palm to the wall, steadying himself. He had won this battle... and yet exhaustion drew him down like a heavy cloak.

Lightning flashed again. He blinked up at a shredded vine dangling above, the distant moon behind drifting clouds. One faint fear remained: he was utterly alone here, with no one to help, no place to go. He would have to walk out of the ravine on his own, wounded as he was. The thought would have broken a weaker boy. Neo growled to himself in stubborn defiance: “Ga ba tseye pelo, ga ke kitla ka bolawa fa.” (They won’t break my heart; I will not die here.)

He sank fully to the ground, drawn in by pain. The spear slipped from his numb fingers and clattered on the stones. He wrapped both arms around his knees, trying to still the trembling. He matched his heartbeat to the rhythm of dripping rain, fighting to steady his nerves.

Ngwana wa Naledi"(Child of the star or Star child(starboy)) The witch muttered to herself she had a theory that this boy could be the one. But she heard in the village that the boy was supposed to be dead because they feed him to the lions and the king is the one who did it the reason is unknown, but here is a young boy in the wild living alone and she then had a sudden chill not the ordinary chill but like a one she recognized that something strange was about to happen Then a voice like a drumbeat rolled out of the night: “Neo… Badimo they heard you.” In the trembling dark, she continued watching because if she helped this boy here it would be a problem for her later but she will do something to make sure this boy makes out alive. She had a feeling that she was not to interfere, so she promised herself if the situation becomes too bad she would step in.

A voice softly spoke in his head, soothing yet urgent. Neo’s eyes snapped open. In the cold dim of the ravine, he recognized the tone of his mother. "Ngwana wa naledi,” it repeated—(child of the star). The darkness in his head began to hum with a gentle power.

Then another voice, patient and ancient, spoke plainly as if right beside him: “Call us, child of the comet.” The air around him grew warm. His cuts stung as if kissed by fire, and blue-white light flared along the edges of his wounds.

Neo exhaled slowly; something ancient had stirred in the darkness.

Neo’s scream tore through the ravine like the crack of thunder itself. For a heartbeat, time seemed to bend—the raindrops froze midair, and the forest around him fell silent, watching. A jagged scar of light lanced down from the storm clouds above, converging on him. The anger and fear that had built up all those lonely years surged out with that cry, and the comet’s fire ignited in his veins.

Suddenly, a roaring heat bloomed in his chest. Neo felt blood and water ripple beneath his feet as if the earth were bowing. His eyes snapped shut under the brilliance. When he opened them, the world shone in cobalt and white. He could feel nothing but raw power: it coursed through his arms, legs, every heartbeat a thunderous drum. He gasped, blood warming in his mouth, but he couldn’t remember ever feeling anything so alive—even when he had first tasted freedom under a different sky.

His head buzzed. Sweat and rain mixed on his brow as lightning danced across the stone wall of the ravine, painting Neo’s face in flickers of blue-white light. He lifted his head. There was movement beside him, a form emerging from the storm’s glow.

The spirit stood taller than any man, its form wreathed in stars and smoke. It looked like a warrior king from the old stories: broad shoulders, strong jaw, an expression of fierce nobility. In its hand it held a spear ignited in primordial flame, long and sharp as a titan’s tooth. Neo recognized the face pattern in its eyes: a Badimo ancestor come out of legend—perhaps a long-lost chief or hero of his clan, summoned to do battle once more.

Neo barely had time to meet its gaze. A hand seemed to rest on his shoulder, not to comfort, but to let him know the power was his to command. With a single, wordless nod from the spectral warrior, Neo felt both fear and exaltation surge through him. He gave a fierce grin and rose to his full height despite the pain, tasting iron and smoke on his tongue.

All around, the forest responded. The vines that climbed the ravine walls twisted upward as if reaching to the heavens. The rafters of the sky echoed Neo’s heartbeat. He planted his spear tip into the muddy ground and raised his free hand to the air.

The specter-ancestor hurled a spear of pure light, and Neo roared in triumph. A blinding bolt of energy shot into the brooding storm cloud above. It seemed to pierce the very heart of darkness. Thunder exploded overhead, closer and louder than ever, and rain came down hard in a sudden drench.

Neo stomped the ground. A shockwave rippled outward. Water and earth flew like spray. Birds shrieked and scattered as the once-dark ravine turned suddenly bright. He felt the electricity of the storm tasting sweet on his tongue.

From the rim of the ravine, weak wails answered—terrified cries of the Shadow Children. They clung to the edges now, shrinking away from the intolerable light.

One of them—a gaunt creature with a twisted grin—darted out of hiding, as if daring Neo to try again. In an instant, the specter’s flaming spear traced a great arc in the air. The blow was swifter than a striking serpent: it cleaved the shadow child in two. A hiss and pop like burning coal, and in a thunderous plume it vanished into nothing.

Another leaped at Neo’s roaring flame, but the warrior-spirit twirled and threw the spear like a javelin across the ravine. The spear winked through the night—a streak of falling star—and impaled the spirit-creature in the chest. With a final screech it disintegrated in a shower of sparks.

Rising thunder blotted out any other sound. Only Neo’s ragged breathing remained. He realized it as the last of the Shadow Children collapsed and evaporated. The ravine was utterly still.

Neo lowered his spear slowly. Lightning flashed again, and for a moment he saw everything drenched in sapphire luminescence. Cracks spider-webbed through the stone walls from where spears and electricity had struck. The edges of his vision shimmered with starfire. He looked down at himself. Every old knife cut and bruise he had carried was gone. His skin, once bruised and bleeding, glowed faintly gold in the lightning. The pain in his shoulder and leg had vanished, replaced by a warm tingling. He flexed his fingers and found them steady. Even his clothes were dry, though the rain was pouring.

For the first time in his life, Neo felt neither fear nor despair. He felt whole—alive, free, at peace. He imagined he could feel the gaze of every ancestor who had ever lived in his blood, proud and protective.

His knees suddenly gave way. He fell into the wet dirt, one hand catching himself. It was all he could do to stay upright.

Lightning crackled violently above, and in that final flash Neo’s whole being was radiant. A lone crow perched on a vine shrieked its caw into the storm. For a split second, Neo’s body shone like a living torch, and in his vision he was a warrior stepping through the gate of stars.

Then Neo dropped to his knees. He closed his eyes, trying to still the power, to let the calm of the night cover him. The storm’s thunder had moved on as quickly as it came. In its wake, the first hints of dawn’s light crept into the sky above the ravine. Only the gentle patter of the finishing rain remained.

He spat into the mud. Blood. The ghost fires had cut him as they had the shadows. A thin trickle slid down his chin. Neo wiped it away. His voice returned in a raspy whisper.

“I… I lived,” he said to the wind, three words that felt like the weight of a lifetime. The ancestors had heard him. The storms had answered.

His body vibrated with exhaustion, but he put a hand to his chest and felt only his pounding heart and that faint warmth of victory. The spear beside him felt heavy and sacred all at once. Lightning-split silhouettes of broken trees and a shattered vine ladder framed him.

He drew in a shaky breath. It would be dawn soon; the summer moon was a pale sliver fading to gray. There was nothing left to fight in these woods tonight.

Neo stood slowly to his feet. Every muscle screamed in protest, but his back went ramrod straight. He dusted the dirt from his pants. Rain had stopped falling; droplets hung from his lashes.

Somewhere far off, a pack of hyenas yelped, as if celebrating. Neo clutched his spear tighter. No one would ever know what happened here tonight. The forest would forget it. But he would never forget he thought to himself.

He stepped out of the ravine into the tall grass and headed toward the distant glimmer of the cave he made his home. But the world swam before his eyes, and darkness claimed him before he could reach safety.

The Village’s Eyes
His first conscious sensation was cool water dripping onto his brow. When Neo opened his eyes again, he saw the thatched roof of a mud-brick hut above him. The air smelled of herbs and smoke. He felt tangled in a woven mat. His head throbbed, and he was dizzy with hunger and pain. A woman he did not know knelt beside him, stirring a clay pot over a small fire. She looked up at him with gentle eyes.

she murmured softly (Be calm, child) the witch that was watching. Her voice was quiet but carried the authority of one who has seen much. Neo tried to pull himself up. His limbs felt weak. “Rest,” she said, pressing a hand gently on his arm. She held a wooden bowl to his lips. “Drink this. It will help.”

Dazed, Neo obeyed. The bitter taste of ginger water slid down his throat, warming his belly. Memory slowly seeped back. Rain-soaked earth, vines, the cry of ghosts in his ears. He winced as he remembered the phantom faces and spears of light. He looked at his hands; they were stained brown with mud and something darker.

“What happened?” he whispered, voice brittle and dry. The woman placed a finger on her lips. “You were very brave,” she said. Her accent was gentle, low. “My spear… my home…” Neo croaked. The pain in his arm made the words cut off.

“Not yet,” the woman said, smiling sadly. “First, you live.” She brushed dirt out of his dreadlocks and nodded toward the grasses outside. “They brought you here after the storm. You are safe now.”

“Where...?” Neo’s world spun. He tried to sit up and stopped himself; his arm burned. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead. He remembered the ravine, the fight. “The shadow monsters…” The dreamlike battle of the ravine pressed close in his mind.

The woman stiffened. “Monsters?” she echoed, all warmth gone from her eyes. She met his gaze steadily. “You are safe,” she repeated, though her tone hinted at worry. She spilled some of the ginger water into her hands and began to pour it over his arm. Neo gasped as the warm liquid mixed with cool rainwater on his skin. He watched as blood and red water ran off, soaking into the cloth.

He tried to speak, but two men’s voices outside interrupted. Heavy footsteps sounded against packed earth. The woman hushed him at once. She pressed Neo back onto the mat, her face a mask of sudden concern. Through the thin wall he heard a man’s stern voice: “He’s awake.”

Then the mud wall slid open. Two guards entered the hut. One was an older man with a shaved head and ritual scars; the other was young, lean, with dark eyes and a spear resting in his hand. Both wore leather jerkins dyed ochre and crimson. Neo’s heart lurched.

The elderly guard spoke quietly to the young one. Neo caught words like “No scratch on him, but eyes wide as the storm,” and “Badimo” and “tokoloshe.” questioned Doman. The lean guard was Doman, he realized—the Khumo’s son. Neo recognized Doman from one of the few times he was spying on the village. Once they had splashed in mud the other children he wanted to play with them but he couldn't so he continued watching as they played among cattle, until Doman had sneered and shoved him away. Now the youth gave him a cold stare. A stylized flame was painted on Doman’s chest piece—the mark of the Kgosi’s (chief’s) clan.

“Neo,” the older guard said, surprise creeping into his tone. “You’re alive.” He stepped forward. Neo felt his spear tremble in his grip and tried to pull himself up. “We heard the storm,” he managed to croak. His throat was raw. “We fought them. The spirits came…”

Doman’s eyes narrowed. “Spirits?” he spat softly. He took a menacing step closer. “You’d have us believe the Tokoloshe didn’t finish you? That our curse failed?” He snarled. There was poison in his words. Neo wasn’t sure what the Tokoloshe was, only that every villager had used that name to fill children’s nightmares.

Neo’s ribs ached from where he had tumbled in the fight, but he pushed to his elbows. “Who is the Tokoloshe? (evil spirit)” he demanded, voice cracking. The word had a strange weight, as if the night itself hung on it.

Doman sneered. “An ancient demon-child tale,” he said. “Even the worst thing in darkness. We saw it that night in our dreams. They taught us to fear it.” He turned partly away, tightening a leather band on his arm. “Now they want you dead by morning, Neo,” he spat. “Let a Tokoloshe walk free? No. If your Badimo didn’t break you, this will.”

“You call me demon-child again,” Neo snapped. He threw himself upright. “If I’m anything, I'm just a normal kid I want to play with the other kids, but you keep calling me names, like the demon child or star child I don't know anything about that I want to be normal” he growled. He stood on unsteady legs, raising his free hand as if to protect himself.

The older guard intervened, stepping between Neo and Doman. “Easy now,” he said sharply. Doman scowled and spat in the dirt.

“You were thrown away as a baby under that star,” Doman continued, ignoring the older guard. “Don’t you remember? We wrote you off. Only the fire-star(comet) was cursed, not invited.” He raised a fist, but the elder guard grabbed his shoulder.

“How did you survive, Neo?” the elder guard asked softly. His deep voice was grim. “Prophecy said you’d be gone. You—child—how did you live?”

Neo’s mouth went dry. He nodded faintly, hand unconsciously pressing against the cut on his arm. “I don’t know,”. Normally he wouldn't be allowed to be in the village and some thought he was dead but only a few knew of the wild child who keeps spying on the village but recently the witch convinced the village to change their mind about the proffecy as it was first thought to be a bad omen but she convinced them that it would be good for the village as she saw he whispered. “I fought… and the ancestors answered.”

The elder guard’s face went pale. “Badimo…?” he murmured to himself. He turned to Doman,Doman was one of the few people who knew of the stratege wild child who spys on the village as he was a patrol guard and had a few encounters with him he thought maybe the boy got lost from one of the distant villages, the king had instructed him to kill any child he saw in the wild but he couldn't bear himself to kill a child he didn't know what those children might have done so a few times he encountered him he chased him away to keep him away from the village and save his live but sometimes he had to be hash and it would take neo some days before he could spot him again he had not reported those encounters because he fear the kings backlash then back to Neo. Slowly, he shook his head. “No wonder the chief is furious,” he said.

The two guards exchanged tense glances, then left the hut. Neo felt the Sangoma’s (Witch from the forest) hand on his shoulder. He had not noticed it, but she had been standing silently in the corner. Her eyes were full of something like pity. She gave Neo a small bow and motioned toward the door. “Let him rest,” she whispered to the guards.

Vow Under the Stars
As they left, Neo found himself outside the hut under a gray dawn sky. A cold breeze tugged at his soaked clothes. All around, the village was stirring to life: distant drums, crackling fires, warriors arming themselves. He clutched his spear again, knuckles whitening.

The Sangoma stood beside him, calm. In her hand was Neo’s amulet, the little carved wooden eye he had worn since infancy. She held it gently. “Your name means ‘gift' ” she said softly, examining the intricate rings carved around the pupil. “You carry the Comet’s blood, and the Badimo’s vision. Take this.”

Before Neo could react, she pressed the amulet back into his hand. “This was your mother’s. It contains words of strength. Remember them.” She wouldn’t say more. Neo slipped the amulet safely under his shirt.

They walked away from the compound’s main square. Even at this early hour, villagers clustered around a glowing fire pit where the dawn ritual would begin. Eight carved wooden banners stood in a circle, each marked with a clan symbol. Neo recognized some of them: the roaring flame of the Kgosi’s fire clan, the swirling wave of the Metsi (water) clan of the river, the lightning bolt of the Dikgoka (lightning) clan of thunder, a horned skull of the cattle-keepers, a rising sun of the harvest clan, and others.

Atop a high wooden dais sat the Kgosi himself, draped in dark cloth and smoking a slender pipe. His eyes were red-rimmed. Though he said nothing, the entire village was silent under his gaze. Neo met his stare for a moment. The chief’s eyes were the color of embers. They were full of fear, anger, and something like guilt.In this village there was an unspoken rule like that ol old of the village "no one but the lion may look at the king".

Neo’s own face burned with shame and anger. He felt raw under so many eyes. The clans watched him like a wilder beast’s rescue. He gripped his spear tightly. The air smelled of smoked meat and sandalwood. Somewhere a rooster crowed — absurdly mundane amid this tension

Suddenly, from the fire pit a carved wooden bull’s head snapped at Neo’s ankles and winked shut. Its eyes glowed. He jumped back with a gasp as a faint click echoed; the trap-door was locked again. On its brass ring was etched a single word: Tokoloho (freedom). Neo swallowed. Tokoloho.

The Sangoma gave him a small smile and patted his arm. “The omen is yours now,” she said softly. “The Child of the Comet walks again.” She added quietly, “But at what price, ngwana (child)?”

Neo said nothing. He looked up at the comet, its pale streak high above. In its tail he thought he saw the faces of his lost family, urging him on. Lightning flashed, as if the dawn itself answered. A chill breeze moved through the village.

He turned back to find the Sangoma already retreating into the shadows of the huts. Behind him, on the roof of the incense tower, two crows let out a long caw. Neo clenched the spear and took a deep breath. Though the night’s battle was done, he realized it was only the beginning of what he must face.

In the silent fields beyond the village, two pale red eyes blinked at the falling morning. The Tokoloshe watched and waited as the comet’s light faded into day.
