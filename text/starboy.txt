Born of the Comet

1.1 The Chase Through the Storm

The night sky tore open with thunder as young Neo Moremi ran through the forest, a wild boy of fourteen summers sprinting in the rain. Lightning flashed through ancient mopane and baobab trees, their twisted branches quivering like arms reaching for unknown hope. Neo was only a waif, an exile with no teacher but nature and no safety save his own cunning. He was the last of the Badimo morafe (clan of ancestors), and though he did not know all that implied, he knew his people were gone and only he remained.

He plunged onward blindly. Behind him thunderous hoofbeats echoed – the heavy steps of a bontebok antelope charging through the mud. But this was no ordinary antelope. Its eyes glowed with a pale unnatural light, as if dying embers burned within its coarse brown coat. Whispering phantoms swirled over its back: the bana ba moriti ("children of shadow") of old tales, chattering and moaning in the storm’s gusts.

Neo rolled to one side as the bok lunged toward him, heart pounding like a drum. He was armed with only wild tools: a rough-thrown lerumo (spear) of acacia wood and, at his waist, the jagged ivory zimele ("willing") – a dagger he had carved himself. Gripping the spear with both hands, Neo steadied on slick roots. The bok turned, lowering its horned head to the ground, and snapped like a coiled scorpion’s sting in the lightning flare. Rain plastered Neo’s tunic to his skin and turned the mud to slick red clay, but he did not flinch.

He vaulted a fallen trunk in a blur of motion, mud spraying up behind him. A forked branch whipped out and snagged his shoulder, but he yanked free and rolled away. Another lightning crack split the sky, and for a moment Neo thought he saw a fleeting shape at the edge of his vision – a forest spirit guiding his steps. He had no time for riddles or ghosts now. The ground surged beneath his boots as he twisted, letting the antelope thunder past, then swung back to meet it again.

The forest was a tangle of shadows and branches, offering escape and death in equal measure. Neo sprinted until he found a narrow ravine slicing through the jungle floor. His foot slipped on the wet moss and he tumbled down into thick red clay. The bok was almost on top of him. It hurtled into the hollow after him, its horn catching on roots as it leapt. Neo landed on shaky feet as the animal skidded to a stop: chest heaving, those strange red eyes fixed on him. Now there was nowhere to run. The chase had ended; now was the real fight.

1.2 Cornered in the Ravine

Neo whipped his head around, spear at the ready, as the bok reared to gore. He was pinned in the muddy ravine with the antelope above. Roots and clay rose like walls on both sides. The spear was steady in his hands, but he knew he could not stay here long. The bok lowered its horn and charged. Neo stood firm and slammed the spear into the animal’s shoulder. The beast bellowed and stumbled – but it was far from done.

Instinct told Neo what to do next. The antelope came charging again. Neo planted his boots deep into the slime and caught a vine curling in the mud. The vine slipped loose in his hands. He swung around as the bok thundered by and hooked it around one horn. The massive creature reared and bucked fiercely, one leg tangled in the vine’s loop. It stumbled, and Neo seized his chance. With a cry he leapt forward.

He drove the zimele upward under the antelope’s jaw and toward its neck. The bok shrieked, a sound like ripping cloth, and tried to twist away. Mud and blood spattered around them as Neo strained with all his strength. The beast thrashed, massive muscles bunching under Neo’s grip, but the boy held fast. Then, with a final push, the dagger bit deep. The antelope gave a strangled snort, quivered, and collapsed face-first into the clay. Silence fell suddenly over the ravine.

Neo staggered, chest heaving and limbs trembling, and sank to his knees beside the fallen creature. The rain began to let up, turning the forest a muted gray. He pressed his hand to his heart, feeling it gallop under his palm. The smell of wet earth and blood filled his nose. Neo looked up at the calm sky beyond the ravine’s lip. He was alive.

1.3 The Little Battle

From the antelope’s body rose curling smoke and the shadow-children separated from it as smoky, wraithlike shapes. The air rippled with low chants as the freed phantoms drifted up around Neo. They moved like wisps of cloud given form, circling the boy with sibilant whispers. One of the creatures, thin and gaunt, crept forward and reached toward his face as if to finish what the beast had begun. Neo jumped back in terror, nearly toppling in the mud.

Fear coursed through the boy’s veins. His muscles ached and his lungs burned, but he scrambled to his feet. He gripped the splintered haft of the broken spear, as useless as a toothpick now. The smoke spirits swirled, their voices rising into a crescendo of malice. Neo stumbled back against the ravine wall. He was sure this was the end.

Then a deep voice thundered from the rainforest wall, and warm light spilled into the clearing. A tall figure appeared: Nandi, the old forest witch and ngaka (healer), stepping through branches as if through a curtain. Her eyes glowed with power, and her arms rose high. She spoke a single word in an ancient tongue. The bana ba moriti ("children of shadow") hissed and screamed, twisting into themselves. In an instant they dispersed like smoke on the wind.

Nandi was at his side in a moment, steadying him. “Easy, child, you are safe now,” she murmured. Her hands were warm on his mud-caked shoulder. He was shaking, but as the fear drained away he realized the voices and darkness were gone. He stared into Nandi’s gentle eyes. “Not tonight,” she said quietly, “you are not mine to have.” She wrapped him in her blankets and lifted him. The night’s terror had passed, carried away on the forest breeze.

1.4 The Village’s Watch

Neo’s eyes fluttered open to a soft firelight. He lay on folded blankets before a clay hearth, warm and sheltered. The smell of smoke and sweet grass hung in the air. Across the fire sat a girl with warm brown skin and eyes bright as polished amber. She watched him quietly. In the faint light he saw Nandi opposite him, gently cradling a tin cup of herbal tea in her hands.

Nandi smiled when she saw him wake. “You live, child,” she said. “The good spirits fought for you in the storm.” Neo pulled himself to sitting and looked around. His body ached but no longer felt cold. “Who… where am I?” he croaked. Nandi’s smile was kind. “You are safe, Neo Moremi,” she said. “In our village, under the thatch of my hut.” He frowned, confused. Nandi reached out and tucked a lock of damp hair behind his ear. “I recognized you from when you were small,” she said. “Your mother came here on a night like this. She said, ‘My son is born of the falling star.’ She named you Moremi and asked me to keep you safe.”

Lerato (“love”) gave him a warm smile as she sat back down. He felt a strange comfort at her presence. Nandi took Neo’s hands and applied a healing balm from a clay bowl. “Your mother was brave, Neo. She trusted me with the promise that you would survive,” the healer said, eyes distant. Neo’s throat tightened. He nodded slowly, not trusting his voice. Lerato sat by his side, patting his back. The ache in his muscles and the tremble in his hands slowly eased. Safe and surrounded by strangers who spoke of stars and home, Neo finally drifted to sleep.

1.5 Sanctuary in the Rain

By morning the rain had eased to a light drizzle. Neo stirred and rose. He took one last look at the small hut and gave a thankful nod to Nandi and Lerato. Nandi waited for him, her eyes bright and peaceful. “You have survived great darkness, Neo,” she said, wrapping a warm cloth around his shoulders. “Your heart is strong. Go with the blessings of the ancestors.” Neo bowed deeply and whispered, “Thank you.”

Lerato came out as well, pulling a blanket around her shoulders. She gave Neo a shy smile and said softly, “Go with the stars, Neo.” He managed a small bow. “Thank you, Lerato,” he replied quietly. She nodded and watched him step onto the forest path. Neo did not look back; he already carried their kindness and hope with him.

The forest canopy soon swallowed the boy. Neo walked until he found a small hidden cave he called home. Inside, the fire’s embers still glowed. He sat down and pulled his dagger zimele from the dirt. He ran the blade along a rough stone, sparks glinting in the darkness. The metal edge became sharp and dry. Outside, the storm moved on. Neo wiped the handle of the dagger clean, his fingers tracing every nick and scar.

Memories of the night’s battle replayed in his mind: the antelope’s fierce eyes, the ghostly whispers, Nandi’s gentle face in the storm, and the bright gaze of Lerato. He pressed the dagger’s tip into the ground and closed his eyes, listening to distant thunder roll on. The rain had stopped, and the first stars peeked through the trees. Neo stepped outside his cave. Above him, the clouds were breaking. In the inky sky a bright star shone, its faint tail trailing behind like a streak of silver flame.

Neo Moremi, the orphan born of a shooting star, stood alone and alive under the misty heavens. He remembered his mother’s words: that a falling star would mark his path. Looking up, he felt both haunted by the past and hopeful for the journey ahead. Thunder rumbled once more in the distance. Yet beneath that distant rumble and the calm, shining night sky, Neo knew his tale was only beginning.
